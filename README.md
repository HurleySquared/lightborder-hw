# Horiseon SEO Accessibility Project
Welcome to the README.md for the Horiseon SEO Accessibility Project.

## Description
- Following Scouts Rule, I condensed the HTML and CSS files to shorten the code
- By removing multiple div containers and replacing them with better suited semantic tags it made the webpage more accessible for those with impairments
- Commented out any changes made to the code so any future pulls from this repo showcase what has been done so any developer has an understanding before altering further
